## Hangman in Ruby

This is a command-line based Hangman game written in Ruby where
the computer generates a random word from the dictionary and the
player must attempt to figure the word out. By utilizing
YAML serialization, a player can choose to save their game or
load a previous game.

####RULES
The computer selects a random word that is symbolized by empty
dashes, each dash corresponding to a letter of the word. The
object of the game is to guess the word in as few turns as
possible. Each turn, the player is given the option to guess a
letter of the word, save their game to a file, or exit the game 
without saving. The player is allowed 6 mistakes, after which the 
game will be terminated. At the beginning, you are given the option 
to either start a new game or reload a previous game from a file.
If you choose to load a previous game, it will place you back exactly
where you were when you chose to save it.

To run the game, enter `ruby hangman.rb` at your command-line.
